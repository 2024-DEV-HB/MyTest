## Test & difficulties encountered

During the completion of the exercice, one of the biggest challenges I faced was applying TDD. It was my first time practicing this methodology, and I had to adapt to writing tests before developing the features.
Despite this, I found the exercice to be very rewarding and interesting, especially for a junior dev like myself. It gave me a better understanding of the importance of testing in development cycle.
